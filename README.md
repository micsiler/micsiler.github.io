Greetings! This is my portfolio website which showcases my experiences and projects. This includes many of the projects I have worked on recently with a focus on data science and machine learning. Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.

## Education
- M.S. Computer Science | Indiana University Bloomington (2024)
- B.S. Computer Science | Indiana University Bloomington (2023)

## Experiences

**STUDENT MENTOR, Artificial Intelligence Maritime Maneuver - Indiana Collegiate Challenge (AIMM ICC)** (Jan. 2024 – April 2024)
- Worked as a mentor on the development of an autonomous boat in a state-wide competition 
- Used computer vision tools (YOLO) to identify buoys for object detection 
- Applied concepts of machine learning and data analysis to improve the performance of CNN vision-based models

**RESEARCH ASSISTANT, Vehicle Autonomy and Intelligence Lab** (Aug. 2022 – Jan. 2024)
- Worked on processes for vehicular robots to self-operate given a simulated environment
- Utilized Python visualization libraries to demonstrate the path of the robot in an aquatic environment given simulated data
- Applied AI algorithms and Control theory on robotic pathing algorithms in Python and C++

## Most Recent Projects

**Multi Object Tracking and Segmentation** *Author(s): Paul Coen, Michael Siler*

*Overview:* The goal of this project was to understand the concepts behind multi-object tracking and segmentation. Moreover, develop an evaluation of the current machine learning models (YOLO, SAM, etc.) on a benchmark dataset. This included a modification of the track anything model to track different objects.

*Applied Skills: Python, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, object detection (YOLO), Segmentation Models (SAM), Object Tracking*
- Conducted empirical evaluation of the tracking model to understand its metric comparison to benchmark standards
- Incorporated machine learning and computer vision tools (YOLO, Segmentation models, and XMem) to identify and track objects within video

**Loan Default Prediction**

*Overview:* This was an attempt at the Kaggle competition: Loan Default Prediction - Imperial College London

*Applied Skills: Python, Machine Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Decision Tree Classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost)
- Utilized machine learning techniques to predict a loan's default probability 
- Incorporated feature selection to reduce computational complexity and provide insight into dataset selection
